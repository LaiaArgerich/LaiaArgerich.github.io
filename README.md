#Project analysis:
Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she
expected to find in your project?
The final user is going to be the person from Human Resources or it could also be a technical person who wants to hire someone.
So, it is going to be (probably) a person who is going to care more about the aesthetics and less about the technical and profound. 
Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a singlepage project, this analysis isnâ€™t very relevant
Modules: basic elements that contain information units
image, info, formacio, experiencia, idiomes, aptituds
Arquitecture: How the modules relate between themselves.
They are structured in two different columns.
Visual design: which color palette will you use? Which typography?
Which page layout? 
I will try to imitate my real, original cv.
The color palette i will use is the following three colors; #B85B22, #775F55, #355D7E
